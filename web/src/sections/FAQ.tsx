                    We are limiting one mint per wallet for each WL wallet

                    that everyone from the community gets an equal chance to
                    initially mint. It also means you don&apos;t have to
                    participate in gas wars or run to the primary market to get
                    yours on mint day. The whitelist mint will run for 24 hours.

                    For the limited amount of Ape Executives that are not minted
                    during the whitelist mint, there will be a public mint. This
                    will also be capped at 1 per wallet, but the practical
                    reality is that it is very easy to mint from multiple burner
                    wallets.

Much of it is not labeled as International Megadigital and typically, most of it is deleted when the project. Our work in NFTs has brought an interesting level of semi-permanence to our work. We have mostly worked in obscurity because making weird anti-corporate art in the evening is a bad look to day-job employers. Some of us have children now and contribute mainly in spirit. Also, making weirdo art under a shroud of anonymous mystery is kind of "sexy." We eternally appreciate everyone who has supported our NFT work so far, and promise that this is only the beginning. We have no illusions that we will appeal to everyone. But hopefully, we will appeal to a small percentage of weirdos, and you all are what actually matters.`,
